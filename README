A little Lua program for extracting the WAD files from the 1997 Data Design Interactive game Conquest Earth.

Usage: lua conquest_earth.lua <filename>
Example: lua conquest_earth.lua C:\CONQUEST\DDI\DEV.WAD

Before running it, create a directory named "output". That's where the extracted files go.

Tested with Lua 5.3, should work on other versions.

This program does not implement decompression of compressed files. You can use either QuickBMS or the DOS version of RNC ProPack (contained with the Amiga version) for that purpose.
